# Number of CPUs to be allocated to the virtual machine.
# Default: 2
cpu: 2

# Size of the disk in GiB to be allocated to the virtual machine.
# NOTE: changing this has no effect after the virtual machine has been created.
# Default: 60
disk: 60

# Size of the memory in GiB to be allocated to the virtual machine.
# Default: 2
memory: 2

# Architecture of the virtual machine (x86_64, aarch64, host).
# Default: host
arch: host

# Network configuration for the virtual machine.
# NOTE: this is macOS only and ignored on Linux.
network:
  # Assign reachable IP address to the virtual machine.
  # Default: true
  address: true

  # Use QEMU user mode (slirp) network as the default route (i.e. for internet).
  #
  # Setting `address` to true provides additional option of using the address' network
  # as the default route, which has proven to be more reliable in some cases.
  # However, it seems to perform worse with VPN enabled.
  #
  # This setting is ignored if `address` is false.
  # Default: true
  userMode: true

# Container runtime to be used (docker, containerd).
# Default: docker
runtime: docker

# Kubernetes configuration for the virtual machine.
kubernetes:
  # Enable kubernetes.
  # Default: true
  enabled: true

  # Kubernetes version to use.
  # This needs to exactly match a k3s version https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases
